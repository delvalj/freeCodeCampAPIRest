## REST API Design Best Practices Handbook – How to Build a REST API with JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js

#


### We'll build a REST API for a CrossFit Training Application. If you're not familiar with CrossFit, it's a fitness method and competitive sport that combines high-intensity workouts with elements from several sports (olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and others).
<br>  

### In our application we'd like to create, read, update and delete WOD's (Workouts of the Day). This will help our users (that will be gym owners) come up with workout plans and maintain their own workouts inside a single application. On top of that, they also can add some important training tips for each workout.
<br>

### Our job will require us to design and implement an API for that application.
